Modern portfolio theory (MPT), or mean-variance analysis, is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk. 
This implementation takes a set of of returns from historical data over some time frame as an input to a quadratic form which can be optimized to minimize risk for a certain target return.
Meant to tet theory in practice
